     * Density (k) is defined as the number of vehicles per unit length of the
     * roadway. In traffic flow, the two most important densities are the
     * critical density (kc) and jam density (kj). The maximum density
     * achievable under free flow is kc, while kj is the maximum density
     * achieved under congestion. In general, jam density is seven times the
     * critical density. Inverse of density is spacing (s), which is the
     * center-to-center distance between two vehicles.
